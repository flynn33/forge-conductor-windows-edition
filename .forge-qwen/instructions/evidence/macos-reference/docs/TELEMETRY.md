# Telemetry architecture (real-time native)

## Product model

Telemetry is a **continuous native stream**, not a multi-second snapshot poll.

| Layer | Behavior |
|-------|----------|
| `RealtimeMetricsEngine` | Samples host CPU/RAM/GPU/disk/process at ~30 Hz via Apple APIs |
| `TelemetryService` | Publishes a live frame on every host sample; forge/MCP recomposed on a short utility cadence |
| Native GUI | Subscribes to the stream; `TimelineView` paints at display rate against latest sample |
| Web UI (`telemetry/static`) | Primary: `EventSource /api/stream?hz=20`; fallback: `/api/live` only if stream stalls |
| HTTP current frame | `GET /api/live` (alias `/api/snapshot`) returns the **current** live frame for tools/compat |

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Role |
|----------|------|
| `GET /` | FORGE RIG static UI |
| `GET /static/*` | `app.js`, `style.css`, … |
| `GET /api/health` | Continuous mode + measured Hz |
| `GET /api/stream?hz=20` | **Continuous SSE** of live frames (keep-alive) |
| `GET /api/live` | Current live frame (JSON) |
| `GET /api/snapshot` | Compat alias of `/api/live` |
| `GET /api/system` | Latest host sample |
| `GET /api/forge` | Last forge composition |

Legacy clients that pass `interval=2` are **not** held to 0.5 Hz — the server upgrades them to a realtime rate.

## What is *not* the product clock

- Multi-second “take a snapshot” timers
- One-shot SSE that closes after a single frame
- GUI `refresh()` as the continuous path (manual forge recompose only)

## Contract

Frame shape still validated by `TelemetryContract` and
`Tests/ForgeConductorTests/Fixtures/telemetry_contract_keys.json`.

Continuous behavior is proven by `RealtimeStreamTests` (engine samples,
service listener frames, multi-event SSE).

## Version

`0.9.0`
